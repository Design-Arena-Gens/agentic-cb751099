   - Email list or Google Group
   - Feedback before launch

3. **Open Testing:**
   - Public but labeled as "early access"
   - Unlimited testers
   - Good for beta testing

## Security Best Practices

### Protect Your Keystore
```bash
# Backup keystore securely
cp panda-ai-release.jks ~/secure-backup/

# Never commit to Git
# Already in .gitignore
```

### Store Credentials Securely
Create `keystore.properties` (in .gitignore):
```properties
storePassword=YOUR_STORE_PASSWORD
keyPassword=YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD
keyAlias=panda-ai-key
storeFile=panda-ai-release.jks
```

### Signing Config in build.gradle
```gradle
android {
    signingConfigs {
        release {
            storeFile file('../panda-ai-release.jks')
            storePassword System.getenv("KEYSTORE_PASSWORD")
            keyAlias "panda-ai-key"
            keyPassword System.getenv("KEY_PASSWORD")
        }
    }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Upload failed"
- Ensure version code is higher than previous
- Check AAB file isn't corrupted
- Try uploading APK instead

### "Privacy policy required"
- Host privacy policy online
- Ensure URL is publicly accessible
- Update link in Play Console

### "Permissions need justification"
- Already handled with permission dialogs
- Add more detail in privacy policy

### "App crashes on review"
- Test on multiple devices
- Check for API key validation
- Ensure graceful error handling
